        <h1 id="What-is-21-blackjack"><a href="#What-is-21-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="What is 21 blackjack?"></a>What is 21 blackjack?</h1><p>21 blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. The object of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting 21 points on your first two cards, or by using strategical decisions to whittle down the dealer’s hand total until you reach 21 or come closer to 21 than the dealer.</p>
<p>The game begins with both players and the dealer receiving two cards face up. All card values are face value except for aces, which are worth 1 or 11 points depending on what makes a better hand. The player can then choose to either take another card (hit) or stay with their current total (stand). After all players have made their decisions, the dealer reveals their card and completes their hand according to standard blackjack rules.</p>
<p>If the player has a total of 21 points on their first two cards, they win instantly (called a blackjack). In all other cases, the highest hand wins, with ties going to the player. Here are some common winning hands:</p>
<p>• One ace and any ten-point card (this is called a “paint” and pays out 3:2)</p>
<p>• Any two ten-point cards (pays out 3:2)</p>
<p>• A five and a six (pays out 2:1)</p>
<p>Players can also place bets on whether they think the dealer has a blackjack (a hand that totals 21), which is paid out at even odds. If you bet on blackjack and win, your payout is 1.5x your original bet amount.</p>
