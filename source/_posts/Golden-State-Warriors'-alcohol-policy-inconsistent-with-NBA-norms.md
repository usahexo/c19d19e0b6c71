#  Golden State Warriors' alcohol policy inconsistent with NBA norms
A recent article in the San Francisco Chronicle highlighted the Golden State Warriors' alcohol policy which is much stricter than that of the NBA as a whole. The article stated that the Warriors do not allow any alcohol to be brought into their arena, even if it is being consumed by those who are not attending the game. In contrast, the NBA allows teams to make their own policies with respect to alcohol. The only restriction is that no alcohol can be sold in arenas during games.

This discrepancy in alcohol policies between the Warriors and the rest of the NBA was on full display when the Warriors hosted the Los Angeles Lakers on March 6th. Lakers fans were able to bring in alcoholic beverages while Warrior fans were not. This led to some Lakers fans taunting Warrior fans by waving their beers at them.

The Warriors' alcohol policy is inconsistent with NBA norms and it creates an unappealing atmosphere for fans. Alcohol consumption is a big part of many sporting events and it is strange that the Warriors are so opposed to it. It would make more sense for them to follow the NBA's lead and allow fans to bring in alcoholic beverages. This would create a more competitive and enjoyable atmosphere for fans.

#  Why San Manuel Casino won't sell alcohol before 5pm during Golden State Warriors games

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians will not sell alcohol before 5 p.m. during Golden State Warriors games, even when the games fall on a day when the casino is normally open until 2 a.m.

“The well-being of our guests is always our top priority, and we want to ensure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience at our casino,” said San Manuel Casino in a statement.

This decision comes after the Warriors announced they were suspending Draymond Green for one game after he got into an altercation with Kevin Durant.

#  San Manuel Casino defends its decision to not sell alcohol before 5pm during Golden State Warriors games

Casino officials say they are in the process of reaching an agreement with the NBA that will allow them to continue not allowing alcohol sales before 5pm during Golden State Warriors games.

San Manuel Casino spokesperson Rick Salinas said the casino has had a long-standing agreement with the Warriors that alcohol sales will not begin until after 5pm on game days. He said the casino is working with the NBA to make sure that agreement continues.

“We have a great relationship with the Warriors and we are working with them to ensure that this policy stays in place,” Salinas said.

The news comes as the casino is facing criticism from some state lawmakers over its decision to not allow alcohol sales before 5pm during any event, including Golden State Warriors games. Assemblymember Jim Cooper (D-Elk Grove) recently sent a letter to San Manuel Casino asking why it was enforcing the policy during Warriors games but not other events.

Salinas said the decision to not sell alcohol before 5pm during Warriors games is based on safety concerns. He said arena security officials have told casino officials that allowing alcohol sales before 5pm could lead to problems.

“We want everyone to have a safe and enjoyable time when they come to our property, and our security officials feel that allowing alcohol sales before 5pm could lead to problems,” Salinas said. “So we are going to continue following this policy until we can reach an agreement with the NBA.”

The San Manuel Casino has announced that it will not sell alcohol during Golden State Warriors games before 5pm. This decision came after the casino received backlash from the team and its fans for selling alcohol before games last season.

When asked about the casino's decision, Warriors players had mixed reactions. "I don't really care one way or the other," said forward Draymond Green. "It doesn't bother me."

Guard Klay Thompson, however, said he was in favor of the casino's decision. "I think it's great," he said. "I think that'll help keep the peace and everything."

Center Zaza Pachulia also weighed in on the issue, saying he thought it was a "great" idea. "It helps to keep everything calm and not too crazy," he said.

The Warriors open their 2017-2018 season on October 17th against the Houston Rockets.
