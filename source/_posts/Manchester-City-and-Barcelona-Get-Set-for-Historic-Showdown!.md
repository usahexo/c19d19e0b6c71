#  Manchester City and Barcelona Get Set for Historic Showdown!

Manchester City and Barcelona are both preparing for their first ever meeting in the Champions League on Wednesday night.

Both clubs have had incredible success in Europe in recent years, with Manchester City reaching the semi-finals for the first time last season, while Barcelona have won the competition four times in the last eleven years.

This game is sure to be a thrilling encounter, with both teams boasting some of the best players in the world. Manchester City will be looking to their superstar striker Sergio Aguero to lead them to victory, while Barcelona will rely on Lionel Messi and Neymar to create chances and score goals.

It is sure to be an exciting match and one that is likely to produce plenty of goals. Manchester City will be confident of getting a positive result at home, but they will need to be careful not to concede too many goals away at Camp Nou if they want to progress to the next round.

#  Casino Bonus Keep What You Win – Could This Be the Year of the Underdog?

The online casino industry is one that is constantly growing, with new casinos launching on a seemingly daily basis. This high level of competition means that casino operators are always looking for ways to attract and retain players, and one way they do this is by offering bonuses. There are many different types of casino bonuses available, but one of the most sought-after is the bonus where you can keep what you win.

There are a number of different terms and conditions associated with casino bonuses, and it’s important to read these carefully before signing up. One thing to look out for is whether the bonus needs to be wagered a certain number of times before you can withdraw any winnings. Many bonuses also have time limits attached, so you need to make sure you are aware of how much time you have to meet the wagering requirements.

Another thing to watch out for is the playthrough requirement. This is the amount that you need to wager before being able to withdraw any winnings from your bonus account. The playthrough requirement can vary from casino to casino, so it’s important to make sure you are aware of what it is before signing up. Some casinos also offer ‘ sticky bonuses’ which cannot be withdrawn even if the playthrough requirement has been met.

One advantage of opting for a casino bonus where you can keep what you win is that there are no wagering requirements attached – so once you have met the playthrough requirement, you can simply withdraw your winnings. This type of bonus is becoming increasingly popular, as more and more players are looking for ways to increase their chances of winning big.

So could 2018 be the year of the underdog? With so many great bonuses on offer, it’s definitely worth giving online casinos a try!
