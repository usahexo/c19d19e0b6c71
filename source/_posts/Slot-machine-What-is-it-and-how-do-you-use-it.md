#  How to Win Money from the Slot Machine on a Vending Machine

Slot machines on vending machines are a great way to make some extra money. They are usually set to pay out around 90% of the money put into them, so there is a good chance of winning something back. However, there are a few things that can be done to improve those chances even further.

The most important thing when playing slot machines on vending machines is to know the payout schedule. This can be found by checking the machine or the brochure next to it. Often, there are different payout schedules for different denominations of coins, so it is important to pick the right one.

In order to get the best odds, it is also important to play the maximum number of coins possible. This is because the payout schedule is usually based on how many coins have been played. By playing fewer coins, the player lowers their chances of winning anything back.

Another thing that can help improve odds is to choose machines that are in good condition.Over time, machines can become worn down and their payout percentage may go down as a result. Checking to see if the machine has been recently serviced can give an indication of how well it is likely to pay out.

Finally, it is also important to note that some machines are programmed to pay out more often than others. So, by playing several different machines, it is possible to increase the chances of winning something back.
