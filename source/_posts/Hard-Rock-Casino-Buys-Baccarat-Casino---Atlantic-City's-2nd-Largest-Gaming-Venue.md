#  Hard Rock Casino Buys Baccarat Casino - Atlantic City's 2nd Largest Gaming Venue

Atlantic City, NJ - The Hard Rock Casino has completed the purchase of the Baccarat Casino, making it the second largest gaming venue in Atlantic City.

The purchase was announced earlier this year and was completed last week. The terms of the sale have not been released.

The Baccarat Casino is a 550,000 square-foot venue that features 2,590 slot machines and 108 table games. The Hard Rock Casino is a 1.5 million square-foot venue that features 4,095 slot machines and 178 table games.

The closure of four casinos in Atlantic City has left a void in the market for larger venues. The Hard Rock Casino hopes to fill that void with the purchase of the Baccarat Casino.

"This acquisition demonstrates our commitment to Atlantic City and our belief that it is still a viable gaming market," said Hard Rock International CEO Jim Allen. "We are excited to bring the world-class entertainment and dining options of Hard Rock to Baccarat's customers."

#  HARD ROCK AC BUYS BacCARAT CASINO 

On March 1, 2019, it was announced that the Hard Rock Atlantic City casino had purchased the BacCARAT casino.

The BacCARAT casino is a smaller, boutique casino that is located in the Marina District of Atlantic City. The purchase price was not disclosed.

This is the first time that the Hard Rock brand has entered the Atlantic City market. The company plans to renovate and rebrand the BacCARAT casino as a Hard Rock property.

The purchase of the BacCARAT casino by the Hard Rock brand follows a series of high-profile casino closures in Atlantic City. In recent years, several casinos have closed their doors in Atlantic City, including Trump Taj Mahal, Revel Casino Hotel, and most recently, Showboat Casino Hotel.

The Hard Rock brand is looking to revitalize the Atlantic City gaming market with its new property. The company has stated that it plans to invest $375 million into renovating and rebranding the BacCARAT casino. The renovation project is expected to create 1,500 jobs.

"We are excited to enter the Atlantic City market and bring our world-famous Hard Rock brand to this destination," said Jim Allen, CEO of Hard Rock International. "This property offers us a great opportunity to expand our presence in an important gaming market and provide new jobs and economic opportunities for the community."

#  All In: Hard Rock Adds Baccarat Casino to Portfolio 

In a move that shows its commitment to the global casino market, Hard Rock International announced this week that it will be adding a baccarat casino to its portfolio. The new property will be located in Ciputra World Surabaya, an integrated lifestyle development in the second-largest city in Indonesia.

The company has been making aggressive moves in recent years to expand its presence in the casino market, with a particular focus on Asia. In 2016, it partnered with nearby City of Dreams Manila to open a new integrated resort. And last year, it teamed up with Malaysia’s Resorts World Genting to build a new casino and entertainment complex set to open in 2020.

Baccarat has emerged as one of the most popular games in the global casino market over the past few years, and Hard Rock is looking to capitalize on that trend by offering it at its properties.

“We are very pleased to be able to offer our guests this exciting game at our world-class integrated resorts,” said Hard Rock CEO Hotels & Casinos, Stephen K. Wynn. “It is another way we can provide guests with an engaging gaming experience they cannot find anywhere else.”

The new baccarat casino at Ciputra World Surabaya is scheduled to open in early 2019.

#  Hard Rock Gets Into The Game, Purchases Baccarat Casino

_Las Vegas, NV_ - _March 2, 2019_ - _In a move that is shaking up the casino world, Hard Rock has announced its purchase of Baccarat Casino. This purchase comes on the heels of the company's recent purchase of the Trump Taj Mahal Casino.

The move signals a shift for Hard Rock, which has typically been focused on music and hospitality. The company now plans to enter into the casino gaming market as well.

Baccarat Casino is a high-end property that is known for its luxury accommodations and its high-stakes games. It has long been considered one of the most prestigious casinos in Las Vegas.

This is not the first time that Hard Rock has purchased a casino property. In 2007, they bought the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. However, this is by far their largest acquisition to date.

With this latest purchase, Hard Rock now owns three of the top ten casinos in Las Vegas in terms of revenue. They are now positioned to become a major player in the gaming market.




Many industry analysts are predicting that this move could spark a wave of consolidation in the casino industry. Other casino companies may feel forced to merge or sell out in order to compete with Hard Rock.

This could be bad news for smaller casinos that are struggling to stay afloat. They may find it difficult to survive in an industry that is becoming increasingly dominated by one large player.
