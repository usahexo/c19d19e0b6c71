The scatter symbol is a diver who awards players with free spins when three or more appear anywhere on the reels. Players can also trigger the game's bonus round by landing three or more of the golden treasure chests anywhere on the reels. In the bonus round, players must choose one of four treasure chests in order to reveal their prize amount.

# What inspired the game's design? 

The original game was inspired by the idea of being able to explore a "vast and limitless" world. We wanted to create a game that would allow players to explore different environments, and encounter new and exciting creatures along the way.

# How does the game engine work?

The game engine is designed to be as realistic as possible. It takes into account things like weather conditions, time of day, and even the player's altitude. This helps to create a more immersive experience for the player.

-Realistic graphics and physics engines 
-A variety of creatures to encounter 
-Different weather conditions and time of day

# How do you trigger the free spins round? 
The free spins round can be trigged in a number of ways. 
One way to do it is to get three or more scatter symbols on the reels. This will activate the free spins round and give you a set number of free spins, usually 10 or 15. Another way to trigger the free spins round is to get three or more bonus symbols on the reels. This will also give you a set number of free spins, usually 10 or 15. The third way to trigger the free spins round is to get three or more wild symbols on the reels. This will again give you a set number of free spins, usually 10 or 15. It's important to note that the triggering symbol doesn't have to appear on any particular reel; it can appear anywhere on the reels as long as there are three or more of them. 

The beauty of online slots is that every spin can be different, so you never know when you might hit the free spins round. So keep spinning those reels and see if you can trigger some free fun!

# What are the highest and lowest possible line bet multipliers? 

The highest line bet multiplier is 10,000x and the lowest is 1x. This is a huge range, and it's important to know what each multiplier means for your potential winnings. 

A line bet multiplier of 10,000x means that if you wager $1 on a single line, you could potentially win $10,000. Conversely, a line bet multiplier of 1x would mean that if you wager $1 on a single line, you would only win $1 back. 

It's important to remember that not all slot games offer the same high or low line bet multipliers. Some games may have a higher maximum multiplier but a lower minimum, while others may have the opposite. Be sure to read the game rules and paytable before playing to see what the highest and lowest possible multipliers are.

# How many paylines are there in total?

There is no one definitive answer to this question. The number of paylines in a slot game can vary from between 1 and 255. However, the most common amount of paylines is 20.

Some games will also give players the option of choosing how many paylines they want to activate. So, if you want to play with all 20 paylines available, you can do that. But if you’re feeling a bit more cautious, you can choose to play with fewer and still have a chance of winning.

# What are the different ways I can win on a slot game?

There are three main ways that you can win on a slot game: through line wins, scatter wins, and wild wins.

A line win occurs when symbols on adjacent reels match up according to the game’s payout schedule. So, if you have two symbols in a row that match, then you’ll get a line win. The amount you win will depend on the size of your bet and the symbols involved in the win.

A scatter win occurs when your symbols don’t need to be in any particular order on the reels in order to count as a win. As long as they appear anywhere on the reels, you’ll get a payout. The size of this payout will usually be based on your total bet amount multiplied by a set payout multiplier.

Lastly, there are wild wins. These occur when one or more of the game’s wild symbols appear on the reels. The wild symbol will substitute for any other symbol in order to create a winning combination.
